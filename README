Chord project 

Language: JAVA 

Run program in Hillchord.java class
should run through main method



README txt file describes how my code implements CHORD using Java
we will do this by implementing an array into a hashtable

PROBLEM:
The purpose of this assignment is to find a random keyID within the range of our circular ID space.
We can find this value by running through each necessary finger table until we land on a keyID that is equivalent
to our desired keyID with a corresponding Node.

SOLUTION & ISSUES:
I had a difficult time avoiding the creation of unnecessary finger tables, so the output
will show fingertables for each node in the array.

My solution can be found in the fingertable of the desired keyID,
I made it so a print statement pops up saying " We have located keyID x in the fingertable for node y" in the fingertable where desired_keyID is found.
if the current keyID = desired keyID OR (keyID = desired keyID +-1 AND keyID != desired keyID)
Note: If the initial Node is greater than our desried keyID, this code will not be able to output that print statement.

Three Methods and a Constructor

1.Hashtable < Integer, Integer> table(int node)
The purpose of this method is to take in a list of ordered Nodes and 
organize each node in order to output their respective fingertable.

This method returns a fingertable for each node.

2.Main 
The purpose of the main method (besides running the program) is to take two user inputs:
> Desired Nodes
> Desired User ID Space
and will continue to iterate until you give the system the correct range of inputs.
Main then passes these two values to the constructor where it calls upon the nodeANDidspace method

3.nodeANDidspace
The purpose of this method is to 
> create an array based on user input from main
> create a random keyID based on our circularidspace
